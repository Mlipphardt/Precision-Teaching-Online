# About Precision Teaching
---
In the clinical field of applied behavior analysis, certified therapists treat individiuals for various developmental and academic delays through manipulation of the environment and breaking down tasks into individual skills to be practiced. One of the most powerful methods used to build the skills of clients is called precision teaching. Precision teaching endeavors to increase the accuracy and speed of a client's responses in order to build fluency and enduring gains in delayed skills. 

Precision teaching trials are often short and frequently involve the presentation of a stimulus followed by a client response, which is typically recorded as rate of responses per minute. These fluency trials are interspered in the midst of teaching trials and are used to track client progress and growth.
